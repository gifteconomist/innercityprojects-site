Juxtapositions exist between ancient and modern through shadow and reflection as visitors participate with the projected footage. The pool becomes an ephemeral canvas in collaboration between painting, dance and film.</p><p>Oasis speaks to us today. In an era of mass migration, with millions of refugees leaving Syria and neighboring countries, we are increasingly accustomed to the need to find respite, to find an oasis, from suffering.  Situated beside images of fertility and renewal in the Ancient Near Eastern galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oasis reminds us of the omnipresence of hope.</p><p>-Adrienne Baxter Bell</p></div></div><div id="contact-anchor" class="contact-sec"><div class="contact-text"><p>Inner City<br>499 Broadway #4<br>10012 New York, NY<br>917 761 4078<br><br>miriamsparker@gmail.com<br>jowoodbrown@gmail.com</p></div></div></div></body></html>
