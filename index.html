                Through works that stage paintings, video, installation and choreographies of presence, InnerCity explores the state of being in-between destinations and how our mind and body can be present in two different places at the same time.

                Miriam Parker and Jo Wood-Brown access this phenomenon of “between-ness” through the architecture of the urban environment.  In layering visual, choreographic, film and sonic elements, their work generates a field that reveals how our structured environments slip between order and fantasy.
