  p A playing field of diverse surfaces some kinetic, merge with the dance and video into changing environments. Sometimes formally, sometimes contextually and other times in contrast to the steady stream of images generated by Miriam Parker as she embodies and powers the installation.
  p Using the visual and auditory landscape Parker creates a narration taking the information from the images of the film and props to tell a story that transforms a conduit from a compass to a prayer wheel into a tightrope walker's balancing pole.
  p At other times the simultaneity of elements comes through the projection - the dancer passes back and forth between the arms of construction workers, the scaffold extends into diagonal movements. Parker utilizes the potential of it all, taking the DNA of the city from the ordinary to the mythic.
