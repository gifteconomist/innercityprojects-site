          p Through works that stage paintings, video, installation and choreographies of presence, InnerCity explores the state of bein in-between destinations and how our body can be present in two different places at the same time.
        .second-section-about
          p Miriam Parker and Jo Wood-Brown access this phenomenon of “between-ness” through the architecture of the urban environment.  In layering visual, choreographic, film and sonic elements, their work generates a field that reveals how our structured environments slip between order and fantasy.

          p The Oasis project began as the reflection of a palm tree filmed in a Los Angeles swimming pool and reimagined in the Assyrian relief court for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Juxtapositions exist between ancient and modern through shadow and reflection as visitors participate with the projected footage. The pool becomes an ephemeral canvas in collaboration between painting, dance and film.
          p Oasis speaks to us today. In an era of mass migration, with millions of refugees leaving Syria and neighboring countries, we are increasingly accustomed to the need to find respite, to find an oasis, from suffering.  Situated beside images of fertility and renewal in the Ancient Near Eastern galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oasis reminds us of the omnipresence of hope.
